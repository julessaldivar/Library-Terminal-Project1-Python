## Summary
This python project utilized fundamental concepts like classes and objects to create a library catalog system. Having ‘Media’ as our parent class, we were able to inherit its attributes such as title, condition, status, and due date into our subclasses ‘Movie’ and ‘Book’. We were then able to override the methods from our ‘Media’ parent class and add the attribute of author for books and director for movies. The user is able to interact via inputs/outputs of our console, which allows them to search, check out, return and add media to the library. For our library system to function we imported ‘Pretty Table’ as a way to easily display our list, and ‘datetime’ in order to set due dates on checked out books. Conditional statements controlled media availability, condition evaluation, and exception handling of our program. Methods and functions handled multiple operations like searching, checking out, and returning items, while optional enhancements like inheritance added versatility for different media types. Our main loop ensured the user was able to stay in the program until they were ready to leave. Overall, these concepts enabled us to create a user-friendly library system in Python.
